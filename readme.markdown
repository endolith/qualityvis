# Article Quality Visualization
This is a javascript gadget for visualizing article quality in the English Wikipdia. We built this gadget for the [San Francisco Mediawiki Hackathon in 2012](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/January_2012_San_Francisco_Hackathon "SF Mediawiki Hackathon").

## Methodology
